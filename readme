# Self-Driving Car Simulation

A browser-based top-down self-driving car simulation built with **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.  
It demonstrates basic AI with sensors and a neural network trained using **mutation-based genetic evolution**. No backend is required — everything runs directly in the browser.
